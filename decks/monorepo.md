## JS Monorepos: a Study of Engineering Systems

kchau@microsoft.com

---

- A practical introduction of JS Monorepos
- What problems exists for engineering systems
- Best solutions we have discovered or built

---

## Tools

Almost all of our tools are written in node.js

- frontend developers can participate in maintaining these tools
- very low friction in publishing and consuming public libraries
- enormous and open ecosystem of re-usable packages

---

# Tech stack of a Node.js tool chain

---

## V8

- C++, parses & runs JS
- Garbage collector
- Bindings for JS to access C++ libraries

---

## Node.js

- modularity with require() and module.exports
- event loop that allows single-threaded JS to have async capability
- a standard library (e.g. for I/O)

---

## Package manager (npm, yarn)

- a package is a folder with a `package.json` file
- registry as a glorified CDN
- authed API for publishing packages
- CLI tool to download package and their dependencies
- CLI to run npm "lifecycle" scripts (e.g.: build, test, bundle, lint)

---

## Node resolution algorithm

```js
// located in /project/path/main.js
require("mymodule");
```

Search paths:

- /project/path/**node_modules**/mymodule/**index.js**
- /project/**node_modules**/mymodule/**index.js**
- /**node_modules**/mymodule/**index.js**
- /**node_modules**/mymodule/**index.js**
- \$HOME/.node_modules/mymodule/**index.js**
- \$HOME/.node_libraries/mymodule/**index.js**
- \$PREFIX/lib/node/mymodule/**index.js**

---

## Monorepos

A single git repo that contains many related packages:

```
root:
  package.json
  packages/
    app/
      package.json
    businesslogic/
      package.json
    ui-components/
      package.json
    utils/
      package.json
```

---

## Importing Code

Importing internal and external code are consistent:

```js
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "ui-components";
```

---

# Monorepo Management Stack

---

## 1. Workspace-enabled package manager

- **Installs externals dependencies** for the repository
- **Links internal packages** to satisfy the node resolution algorithm
- Optional: **hoisting**, **strictness** enforcement (phantom deps)
- On the market: `yarn`, `pnpm`, `rush`, `lerna + npm`

---

## Problem 1.1: Doppelgangers

Dealing with transitive deps of different versions

```
a/
  node_modules/
    b/
      node_modules/
        react/
          package.json  <-- react@2.0.0
    c/
      node_modules/
        react/
          package.json  <-- react@2.0.0
    react/
      package.json      <-- react@1.0.0
```

> more info: https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/npm_doppelgangers/

---

## Problem 1.2: Phantom Dependencies

`yarn` v1 will "hoist" all the deps up to the top level

```
node_modules/
  react/
    package.json        <-- react@1.0.0
b/
  package.json          <-- does not depend on react
a/
  package.json          <-- depend react
```

Now modules inside "b" can **accidentally** be allowed to depend on react

---

## Solutions

- `yarn` v2,
- `midgard-yarn` (for perf, v1 behavior)
- `pnpm` workspace
- `npm` v7+
- No silver bullet, sorry!

---

## 2. Task scheduler & runner

- **Runs npm scripts** for all packages
- **Optimize** task run speeds at the dev machine and CI
- Optionally in **topological** order or in **parallel**
- On the market: `lerna`, `wsrun`, `rush`, `pnpm recursive`, `lage`

---

## Problem Statement

Optimizes package tasks in a monorepo for a single machine

---

## Solution

A task runner that is:

- **Open sourced**
  - easily shared, public development demands **polish**
  - **easily contributed** to by many groups
- Works with all workspace implementations
- Easy setup
- Minimize idle CPU cores
- **Sublinear increase** in build time per package

---

_... doesn't exist out there, so we built one..._

# Lage

> _v. to make (Norwegian); pr. LAH-geh_

- Open sourced: https://github.com/microsoft/lage
- Easy to integrate with existing codebase
- Scales up with pipelining
- Scales out with caching and scoping
- Contributions from: OXO, FAST, ODSP, Bohemia (Fluid Exp)

---

## How does it work?

https://microsoft.github.io/lage/guide/levels.html

---

## How to try it at home?

https://microsoft.github.io/lage/guide/getting-started.html

1. npm scripts (build, test, lint) are at package level
2. `npx lage init`

   - creates a `lage.config.js` - configure it
   - adds `lage` as a dep

3. `yarn lage build` or `npm run lage build`

---

## 3. Package publish tool

- Automated management of **semver** based on a change description
- **Validation** of description of changes
- **Synchronize versions** between npm registry and git repository
- Automated management of **changelog**
- On the market: `rush`, `lerna`, `semantic-release`, `beachball`

---

## Solution

Use an automated package versioning manager

---

1. Make a new branch, edit code
2. Run a CLI tool to create a "change file"

```
> beachball change


Please describe the changes for: beachball
? Change type Â» - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>   Patch      - bug fixes; no backwards incompatible changes.
    Minor      - small feature; backwards compatible changes.
    None       - this change does not affect the published package in any way.
```

3. Push branch & create a PR with complete with change file

---

# Appendix

---

## Node.js modularity

The current standard is called "CommonJS"

- 1 JS file is a "module"
- modules can import and export code

---

## Imports and Exports

```js
// speech.js
module.exports = {
    sayHello: (name) => console.log(`hello ${name}`);
}

// main.js
const { sayHello } = require('./speech');
sayHello("humans!")
```

---

## Module state

require() caches the module exports as well as the state

```js
// count.js - Keeping count
let count = 1;
module.exports.inc = () => count++;

// main.js
const { inc } = require("./count");
console.log(inc()); // displays: 1
console.log(inc()); // displays: 2
```

> advanced mode: you can clear this cache to reset state & "hot reload" the module
