To fully appreciate how lage gives you the best build performance compared to other monorepo task runners, take a look at this example.

Depending on the graph of the packages, CPU cores are left idle wasting developer time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guide/priority":{"id":"Guide/priority","title":"Priorities","description":"As your repo gets more and more complex, you\'ll need to do some some profiling to understand bottlenecks. Sometimes, the package tasks are not queued in the order that will produce the most optimized run times.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guide/profile":{"id":"Guide/profile","title":"Profiling `lage`","description":"A particularly complex monorepo can present opporunities for optimization. For example, when there are really large packages, it might be more efficient to break those up so the build can be split across different CPU cores. lage greatly enhances the ability for developers to see where the bottlenecks are.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guide/README":{"id":"Guide/README","title":"Introducing Lage","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guide/remote-cache":{"id":"Guide/remote-cache","title":"Remote Cache","description":"As your repo grows in size and complexity, the build takes longer and longer even locally. lage elegantly provides an incremental build capability given a locally available cache. When we pair the caching capability of lage with a cloud storage provider, we can speed up local builds with remote cache made available by Continuous Integration, or CI, jobs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Guide/scopes":{"id":"Guide/scopes","title":"Scoped builds","description":"Scoping a task runner can speed up the process especially if there are distinct clusters of packages that are not related to each other within the repository. lage has a scope option that allows the task running to proceed up to the packages found that matches the scope argument. This is a string matcher based on the name of the packages (not the package path).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introducing Lage/Overview":{"id":"Introducing Lage/Overview","title":"Overview","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
