// This is the config file for `dts-bundle-generator`, which is basically like Rollup for dts files.
// https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator/blob/master/src/config-file/README.md
//
// Since `lage`'s config types are defined in `@lage-run/cli` (and its dependencies), and `lage` ships
// a bundle rather than installing dependencies, it's also necessary to bundle the types in case
// consumers want to use them in their own lage configs.
//
// Ideally we would only have a single dts bundle, but there are a couple problems:
// - `lage` types extend from `backfill-config` types, and there are some naming conflicts.
// - `lage` types sometimes reference or re-export `backfill-config` types under different names,
//   which isn't handled well by `dts-bundle-generator`.
//
// As a workaround, the `backfill-config` types are bundled in a separate file, and the imports
// in bundled `lage` types will be rewritten later (by scripts/update-dts-bundle.js) to point to
// the local `backfill-config` bundle file rather than the npm package.
//
// The update script also does some basic validation: mainly detecting if a new dep is used which
// needs to be added to one of the `inlinedLibraries` lists below.
