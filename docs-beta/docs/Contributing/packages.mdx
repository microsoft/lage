`lage` itself is a [monorepo](https://github.com/microsoft/lage/tree/master/packages). We dogfood our own task runner, of course! The packages and their responsibilities are listed below:

<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl("/img/contributor-guide-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/contributor-guide-dark.png"),
