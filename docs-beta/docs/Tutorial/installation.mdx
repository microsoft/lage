Getting started with `lage` is easy. We have already covered the automated installation in the [Quick Start](/Quick Start) guide. If you prefer having more control, read about how to install `lage` manually in this page.

## Manually install `lage` in a Yarn and PNPM workspace

You can manually install `lage` as well.

### 1. Place `lage` in the `devDependencies` at the root level.

Feel free to replace `latest` tag with something specific. Take a look at the [npm link for lage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lage) to see what the latest version may be at the time.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    ...,
    "lage": "latest",
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Add a `lage.config.js` file to configure the pipeline:

```js
module.exports = {
  pipeline: {
    build: ["^build"],
    test: ["build"],
    lint: [],
  },
};
```

### 3. Inside your monorepo, run `yarn` or `pnpm install`

```
yarn
```

or

```
pnpm install
```

### 4. Run `lage` commands

```
yarn lage build
```

or

```
pnpm run lage build
```
