`jest` is arguably the fastest test runner in the JavaScript ecosystem. Other monorepo task runners tip toe around `jest` because it has its own worker pool / multi-threaded capability. In fact, even monorepo task runners like `nx` and `turbo` all have to work around the fact that we only have a certain finite number of CPU cores!

The solution given usually is to switch to using `--runInBand` when running `jest` via those tools. This will result in the task runners scheduling the work across CPU cores instead of `jest` doing so. However, this causes its own problems:

- For packages containing a substantially large number of tests - those packages are punished to be running all their tests in serial against one single core.
- In the case of local development - if you are modifying a package with lots of tests, you would end up hitting the serialized test run case for every change!

Thankfully, `lage` has learned to play well with `jest` via a concept called **weighted targets**!

## Weighty targets and workers

First off, we will configure our `lage.config.js` like this:

```js title="/lage.config.js"
const glob = require("glob");

module.exports = {
  pipeline: {
    test: {
      type: "worker",
      weight: (target) => {
        // glob for the target.cwd and return the number of test files
        return glob.sync("**/*.test.js", { cwd: target.cwd }).length;
      },
      maxWorkers: 8,
      options: {
        worker: path.join(__dirname, "scripts/workers/jest-worker.js")
      }
    }
  }
};
```

Notice above that we have added a `weight` key to the target configuration. It can be a constant number `weight: 4`, or `weight: os.cpus().length - 1`. But it is really good to help the scheduler know how many workers are really needed given a package's count of test files (this is to make sure packages without many tests do not arbitrarily take up more cores than needed).

The `jest-worker.js` implementation will use the calculated `weight` in its call into `jest` APIs:

```js title="/scripts/workers/jest-worker.js"
const { runCLI } = require("jest");

/** @type {import('lage').WorkerRunnerFunction} */
async function jest(data) {
  const { target, weight } = data;
  console.log(`Running ${target.id} with a maxWorker setting of ${weight}`);

  const { results } = await runCLI(
    {
      maxWorkers: weight,
      rootDir: target.cwd,
      passWithNoTests: true,
      verbose: true
    },
    [target.cwd]
  );

  if (results.success) {
    console.log("Tests passed");
  } else {
    throw new Error("FAILED");
  }
}

module.exports = jest;
```

And just like that, `lage` and `jest` work in harmony to provide the best developer experience via remote cache, scoped test skipping by package dependencies, and cooperating worker pool via weighted targets.
