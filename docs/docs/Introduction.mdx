Your JavaScript repository has grown large enough that you have turned to using a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools) to help you organize your code as multiple packages inside a repository. That's great! However, you realized quickly that the build scripts defined inside the workspace have to be run in package dependency order.

There exist many tools in the market that provide ways for you to run these npm scripts in the correct topological order. So why choose `lage` for your repository?

1. `lage` is battle tested - it is in use by many JavaScript repositories number in the millions lines of code each
2. `lage` can be easily adopted - all it takes is just one npm package install with a single configuration file for the entire repository
3. `lage` supports remote cache as a fallback - never build the same code twice
4. `lage` is optimized for modern multi-core development machines - don't waste your CPU resources waiting on a single core when you have so many to spare!

## How does `lage` schedule tasks?

`lage` has a secret weapon: it has a "pipeline" configuration syntax to define the implicit relationship between tasks. Combined with a package graph, `lage` knows how to schedule which task to run first and which one can be run in parallel. Let's look at an example:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Package graph with task graph equals target graph"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/img/graph-diagram-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/graph-diagram-dark.png")
  }}
  style={{
    width: "100%"
  }}
/>

## How does `lage` make builds faster?

So how does `lage` make builds faster? To fully appreciate how `lage` gives you the best build performance compared to other monorepo task runners, take a look at this example. Here we have a repo with this dependency graph:

import Mermaid from "@theme/Mermaid";

<Mermaid
  chart={`
graph TD
  FooCore --> BuildTool
  BarCore --> BuildTool
  FooApp1 --> FooCore
  FooApp2 --> FooCore
  BarPage --> BarCore
`}
/>

### Level 1: Legacy Workspace Runners

First, let's take a look at the typical workspace runners. `Lerna` (before), `pnpm recursive`, `rush` and `wsrun` all will run one task at a time. This creates a sort of "build phase" effect where `test` scripts are not allowed to run until `build`.

  section FooApp2

    build: fa2_build, after fc_build, 12s
    test: fa2_test, after total_build, 8s
  section BarCore
    prepare: bc_prepare, after bt_prepare, 10s
    build: bc_build, after bt_build, 10s
    test: bc_test, after total_build, 16s

    build: bp_build, after bc_build, 25s
    test: bp_test, after total_build, 12s
`}
/>

### Level 2: Scoping

One of the first way to speeding up build jobs is to use "scoping." Usually a change only affects a subset of the graph. We can get rid of the builds of `FooCore`, `FooApp1` and `FooApp2` if the only changes are inside `BarCore`. However, we'll note that `BarPage` is still affected, resulting in this.

    test  : active, total_test, after total_build, 16s
	section BuildTool
    prepare: bt_prepare, 0, 10s
    build  : bt_build, after total_prepare, 10s
    test   : bt_test, after total_build, 6s
	section FooCore
	  skipped: 0
  section FooApp1
	  skipped: 0
  section FooApp2
	  skipped: 0
  section BarCore *
    prepare: bc_prepare, after bt_prepare, 10s
    build: bc_build, after bt_build, 10s
    test: bc_test, after total_build, 16s
  section BarPage
    prepare: bp_prepare, after bc_prepare, 10s
    build: bp_build, after bc_build, 25s
    test: bp_test, after total_build, 12s
`}
/>

### Level 3. Caching

To further improve build times, we can take advantage of build caches. If we had previously built certain packages, we should be able to speed up the build with a cache. Here, the `BarCore` packages have already been built and tested, and so

  section Total
    Level 1: 0, 105s
    Level 2: 0, 91s

    build  : active, total_build, after total_prepare, 37s
    test  : active, total_test, after total_build, 12s
	section BuildTool
    prepare: bt_prepare, 0, 10s
    build  : bt_build, after total_prepare, 10s
    test   : bt_test, after total_build, 6s
	section FooCore
	  skipped: 0
  section FooApp1
	  skipped: 0
  section FooApp2
	  skipped: 0
  section BarCore
    prepare: bc_prepare, after bt_prepare, 10s
    build: crit, bc_build, after bt_build, 2s
    test: crit, bc_test, after total_build, 2s
  section BarPage *
    prepare: bp_prepare, after bc_prepare, 10s
    build: bp_build, after bc_build, 25s
    test: bp_test, after total_build, 12s
`}
/>

### Level 4. Pipelining

Finally, the last thing we can to speed things up is to break down the wall between build phases from the task runner. In `lage`, we define the relationship between scripts in the `pipeline` configuration.

`}
