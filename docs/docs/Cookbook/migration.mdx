# Migration Guide

## v1.x -> v2.1

<Badge>version 2</Badge>

Lage has many changes from 1.x to 2.x. This migration guide will go over major changes and breaking changes since 1.x.

### New Features

1. Revamped Website! You're reading it now!
2. New non-`npmlog` based default logger
3. The reporter _name_ `adoLog` has been renamed to `azureDevops` (old name is still useable, just deprecating in the next major version!)
4. `WorkerRunner` to help make tools like lint or TypeScript run super fast by reusing context in a [dedicated worker](./make-lint-fast.mdx) (e.g. ESLint instance, TypeScript program)

### Breaking Changes

1. `lage` now will automatically write remote cache if the typical environment variable is set (e.g. CI or TF_BUILD)
2. `info` command is currently not implemented yet
3. `graph` command is current not implemented yet

## v0.x -> v1.x

<Badge>version 1</Badge>

Lage is graduating to 1.0.0! We have a breaking change. Namely, the remote cache mechanism is changing. See this [PR #172](https://github.com/microsoft/lage/pull/172) for details. The behavior is [described here](Tutorial/remote-cache.md). The behavior is changed for remote cache:

1. `lage` only write to a remote cache if the environment variable `LAGE_WRITE_REMOTE_CACHE` is set to true
2. remote cache now works as a fallback; always reading & writing to the local cache first
