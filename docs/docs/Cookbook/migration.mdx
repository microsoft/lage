# Migration Guide

## v1.x -> v2.1

<Badge>version 2</Badge>

Lage has many changes from 1.x to 2.x. This migration guide will go over major changes and breaking changes since 1.x.

### New Features

- Revamped Website! You're reading it now!
- New non-`npmlog`-based default logger
- The reporter `adoLog` has been renamed to `azureDevops` (old name is still useable, just deprecating in the next major version!)
- `WorkerRunner` to help make tools like lint or TypeScript run super fast by reusing context (e.g. ESLint instance, TypeScript program) in a dedicated worker. This must be configured per tool; see examples for [TypeScript](./make-ts-fast.mdx), [ESLint](./make-lint-fast.mdx), and [Jest](./make-jest-fast.mdx).

### Breaking Changes

- `lage` requires **Node 16**, or using the `--experimental-abortcontroller` flag in Node 14
- `lage` now will automatically write remote cache if the typical environment variable is set (e.g. `CI` or `TF_BUILD`)
- `info` command is not implemented yet
- `graph` command is not implemented yet

#### Using `lage` v2 with Node 14

If you're still on Node 14, you can use Lage v2 by wrapping it with a script which passes the `--experimental-abortcontroller` flag, and using that wrapper in your other scripts.

Relevant parts of `package.json` (omit the comments):

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    // cross-env sets environment variables on any platform
    "lage": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=\"--experimental-abortcontroller\" lage",
    // Be sure to use `yarn lage` rather than only `lage` in your other scripts!
    "build": "yarn lage build"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "cross-env": "^7.0.0",
    "lage": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## v0.x -> v1.x

<Badge>version 1</Badge>

Lage is graduating to 1.0.0! We have a breaking change. Namely, the remote cache mechanism is changing. See this [PR #172](https://github.com/microsoft/lage/pull/172) for details. The behavior is [described here](Tutorial/remote-cache.md). The behavior is changed for remote cache:

1. `lage` only write to a remote cache if the environment variable `LAGE_WRITE_REMOTE_CACHE` is set to true
2. remote cache now works as a fallback; always reading & writing to the local cache first
