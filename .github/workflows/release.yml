# Only run one release at a time to avoid duplicate attempts to publish particular versions.
# To avoid backups after multiple pushes in rapid succession, the prerelease job below emulates
# batching (which github actions don't support) by skipping the release job if a newer run is pending.
#
# (There's an option "cancel-in-progress" to cancel in-progress workflows upon a new request, but
# that's not safe because it could potentially cause a job to be cancelled in the middle of the
# actual npm publish step, leaving things in an inconsistent state.)
