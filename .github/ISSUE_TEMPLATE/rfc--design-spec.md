# Detailed Design

- Use diagrams

You can use mermaid:

```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```

Use images by drag & drop

- Describe different feature areas and how they are architected (designed)
- Make sure another set of developer can roughly understand how your code will be organized after reading this section!

# Test Plan

- How will you make sure these features are to be tested
- Specify if leveraging any NEW test framework or techniques

# Performance, Resilience, Monitoring

- Discuss any impact on performance (both as a developer and as a consumer)
- Any expected change in the ability to deal with spotty networks (resilience?)
- How will you monitor or collect telemetry on the features?

# Security & Privacy

- Will the feature have any security or privacy issues?
- What are some ways to mitigate these issues?

# Accessibility
